# Whats My Goal

Long-term thinking helps you determine what you think is most important in your life and thus provided clarity. But long term goals looks huge impossible and thus we procastinate.
So, I write my 5-year goals or 10-year goals break them done to my 1-year goal then, 1-year to 1-month to 1-week to 1-day goals. This is what the application will help you to create and track those goals.
